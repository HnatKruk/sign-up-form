# SIGN-UP-FORM
SIGN-UP-FORM is my personal pet project designed to practice, improve and showcase my skills in working with forms, validation and tables.
The main goal of this project is to improve the skills of working with tables and forms. To work with a new for me validation tool. Also learn how to configure a project using Vite.
I believe that every stage of this project contributes to my professional growth and I am open to feedback and improvements. This is another step towards development and self-improvement

The project is also available online. You can check it out at this link: <a href="https://hnatkruk.github.io/sign-up-form/" target="_blank">SIGN-UP-FORM</a>
